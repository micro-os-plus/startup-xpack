## A source library xPack with the ÂµOS++ portable startup code for bare-metal platforms

This project provides a portable startup code for bare-metal platforms.

The myth that startup code must be written in assembly because
'the C environment is not ready' is plainly wrong.

The 'C environment' is mainly the stack (and maybe other architecture
ABI registers, like GP on RISC-V), and this can be set in a short
assembly entry code and then the standard `_start()` function can
be safely called.

The project is hosted on GitHub as
[micro-os-plus/startup-xpack](https://github.com/micro-os-plus/startup-xpack).

## Maintainer info

This page is addressed to developers who plan to include this source
library into their own projects.

For maintainer info, please see the
[README-MAINTAINER](README-MAINTAINER.md) file.

## Install

As a source library xPacks, the easiest way to add it to a project is via
**xpm**, but it can also be used as any Git project, for example as a submodule.

### Prerequisites

A recent [xpm](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/),
which is a portable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) command line application.

For details please follow the instructions in the
[xPack install](https://xpack.github.io/install/) page.

### xpm

Note: the package will be available from npmjs.com at a later date.

For now, it can be installed from GitHub:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install github:micro-os-plus/startup-xpack
```

When ready, this package will be available as
[`@micro-os-plus/startup`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@micro-os-plus/startup)
from the `npmjs.com` registry:

```sh
cd my-project
xpm init # Unless a package.json is already present

xpm install @micro-os-plus/startup@latest

ls -l xpacks/micro-os-plus-startup
```

### Git submodule

If, for any reason, **xpm** is not available, the next recommended
solution is to link it as a Git submodule below an `xpacks` folder.

```sh
cd my-project
git init # Unless already a Git project
mkdir -p xpacks

git submodule add https://github.com/micro-os-plus/startup-xpack.git \
  xpacks/micro-os-plus-startup
```

## Branches

Apart from the unused `master` branch, there are two active branches:

- `xpack`, with the latest stable version (default)
- `xpack-develop`, with the current development version

All development is done in the `xpack-develop` branch, and contributions via
Pull Requests should be directed to this branch.

When new releases are published, the `xpack-develop` branch is merged
into `xpack`.

## Developer info

TBD
